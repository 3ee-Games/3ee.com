PK2 is a parody off Mortal Kombat and Pong\u2026 but I know I can come up with a better way of designing the controls. Back then, I used PK1 as the example, which in turn used the Mortal Kombat controls. Those controls just don\u2019t translate well on the keyboard as they do on a gamepad.
So what ends up happening here is you have to print out the manual (same goes for the cheat guide) or write down the moves. I don\u2019t mind games that provide a manual but that\u2019s not the first thing I want to do with a new game\u2026 I\u2019d rather play it first!`),Oo.forEach(t),Qa=d(re),De=i(re,"LI",{});var Co=n(De);dt=i(Co,"STRONG",{});var Os=n(dt);Xa=m(Os,"The AI can cheese you:"),Os.forEach(t),Za=m(Co,`
You might start noticing when you hit the ball, sometimes it goes directly to the opponent! The cool part is, your adversary slow down to return the ball back. Cheesy? Extra cheese! I don\u2019t recall the intervals where the opponents fire their special weapons but it was increased as you progressed. That seems okay.
The last boss, White Paddle spams you with his fireballs. That was actually intentional! The strategy to beat him is to keep hitting the ball and dodging the fireballs\u2026 White Paddle isn\u2019t good at actually hitting the ball. Cool strategy but how many deaths (no continue option) could you chalk up before figuring that one out?`),Co.forEach(t),eo=d(re),Fe=i(re,"LI",{});var zo=n(Fe);ut=i(zo,"STRONG",{});var Cs=n(ut);to=m(Cs,"Pong: the ball:"),Cs.forEach(t),ao=m(zo,`
The ball itself doesn\u2019t follow proper physics, which leads to another problem: you\u2019ll notice sometimes the ball will bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen over and over\u2026 and can be extremely annoying, especially when you slide your paddle and smack the ball. You expect the ball to move in that direction. I should have played around with the AI more and come up with some physics.
Many times, the ball can get stuck behind your paddle or the opponent. Losing or winning a match like that feels so wrong. That could have been easily fixed.`),zo.forEach(t),re.forEach(t),Ut=d(e),ue=i(e,"P",{class:!0});var zs=n(ue);G=i(zs,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,title:!0,class:!0}),zs.forEach(t),Vt=d(e),me=i(e,"P",{class:!0});var $s=n(me);N=i($s,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,title:!0,class:!0}),$s.forEach(t),Jt=d(e),W=i(e,"UL",{});var Ta=n(W);Ue=i(Ta,"LI",{});var $o=n(Ue);mt=i($o,"STRONG",{});var Rs=n(mt);oo=m(Rs,"The menus:"),Rs.forEach(t),so=m($o,`
A game that uses the keyboard as the main controls\u2026 you should be able to select the menu options with the keyboard arrows\u2026 not just the mouse. Feels weird.
The options screen sucks. There really isn\u2019t any options. There are more options in the debug menu. However, the option screen follows Mortal Kombat option screens: lack of options unless you used codes to unlock more options.`),$o.forEach(t),io=d(Ta),Ve=i(Ta,"LI",{});var Ro=n(Ve);ct=i(Ro,"STRONG",{});var Ys=n(ct);lo=m(Ys,"Way too many secrets:"),Ys.forEach(t),ro=m(Ro,`
There are so many, many, many secrets in the game which in turn are extremely difficult if not impossible to access. The design document says 92 secrets. That is insane. Maybe I was thinking \u201Creplay\u201D value?
The best secret is the built in debug menu where you can simply choose a \u201Csuper secret paddle\u201D and run through the game. Or choose the \u201Csecret paddle menu\u201D and pick \u201CAwesome Paddle\u201D, who takes up the entire screen and never misses a ball!`),Ro.forEach(t),Ta.forEach(t),Qt=d(e),ce=i(e,"P",{class:!0});var Bs=n(ce);L=i(Bs,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,title:!0,class:!0}),Bs.forEach(t),Xt=d(e),pe=i(e,"P",{class:!0});var Ds=n(pe);H=i(Ds,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,title:!0,class:!0}),Ds.forEach(t),Zt=d(e),Je=i(e,"P",{});var Fs=n(Je);no=m(Fs,"Fighting a secret paddle: a match against Wacky Paddle (the stars have to align perfectly to unlock Wacky) is nearly impossible.
