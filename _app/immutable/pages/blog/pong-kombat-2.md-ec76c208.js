You might start noticing when you hit the ball, sometimes it goes directly to the opponent! The cool part is, your adversary slow down to return the ball back. Cheesy? Extra cheese! I don\u2019t recall the intervals where the opponents fire their special weapons but it was increased as you progressed. That seems okay.
The last boss, White Paddle spams you with his fireballs. That was actually intentional! The strategy to beat him is to keep hitting the ball and dodging the fireballs\u2026 White Paddle isn\u2019t good at actually hitting the ball.

The ball itself doesn\u2019t follow proper physics, which leads to another problem: you\u2019ll notice sometimes the ball will bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen over and over\u2026 and can be extremely annoying, especially when you slide your paddle and smack the ball. You expect the ball to move in that direction. I should have played around with the AI more and come up with some physics.
Many times, the ball can get stuck behind your paddle or the opponent. Losing or winning a match like that feels so wrong.

There are so many, many, many secrets in the game which in turn are extremely difficult if not impossible to access. The design document says 92 secrets. That is insane. Maybe I was thinking \u201Creplay\u201D value?
The best secret is the built in debug menu where you can simply choose a \u201Csuper secret paddle\u201D and run through the game.
