<p>3ee Games offers video games that let you connect with other users and join public communities. Our services might also include access to specific software, features, and content available for purchase from us or others.</p>
<p>All games developed by 3ee Games are provided by 3ee Games LLC.</p>
<h2 id="age-requirements"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#age-requirements"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Age Requirements</h2>
<p>By using our services, you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet your country’s minimum digital consent age. We provide a list of minimum ages worldwide as a resource, but we can’t guarantee its accuracy.</p>
<p>If you meet your country’s age requirement but lack the authority to consent to our terms, your parent or guardian must agree to our terms for you. Parents or legal guardians are responsible for their teenager’s activity on our services and must also comply with these terms.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-expect"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-you-can-expect"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What You Can Expect</h2>
<p>We’re continually developing new features and products to enhance 3ee Games. As part of this process, we might add or remove features, introduce new services, or discontinue old ones. Although we strive to prevent disruptions, we can’t guarantee that there won’t be any outages or changes to services, and your content may become irretrievable. We aren’t liable for such issues.</p>
<h2 id="your-account"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#your-account"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Your Account</h2>
<p>To access our services continuously, you need to create a 3ee Games account. You can provide a username, password, and contact information (such as email and/or phone number). For certain features or communities, you may need to verify your account or add extra details. Our Privacy Policy explains the information we collect and how we use it in greater detail.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for your account’s security and must notify us immediately if you suspect it’s been compromised. Use a strong, unique password for your 3ee Games account, and enable two-factor authentication. If your account is compromised, we may be unable to restore it.</p>
<p>Keep your account’s contact information up-to-date. If you’re locked out, we need to reach you at the email or phone number linked to your account. We might not be able to restore your 3ee Games account if you lose access to that contact information. We may also assume that any communication from your account or associated contact information originates from you.</p>
<p>Don’t license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written approval.</p>

<h3 id="license-to-our-software"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#license-to-our-software"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>License to Our Software</h3>
<p>Some services allow you to download client software. As long as you follow these terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, and non-assignable license to download, install, and run the software, solely to access our services.</p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or services.

<h2 id="termination"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#termination"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Termination</h2>
<h3 id="your-right-to-terminate"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#your-right-to-terminate"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Your Right to Terminate</h3>
<p>You can stop using 3ee Games’ services at any time and for any reason. To delete your 3ee Games account, visit the <a href="/account/profile/">account profile</a> page. You can also disable your account, which limits the processing of your personal information as outlined in our <a href="/account/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. Disabling your account doesn’t terminate this agreement.</p>
<h3 id="our-right-to-terminate"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#our-right-to-terminate"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Our Right to Terminate</h3>
<p>Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and/or your access to some or all of our services without notice, at our discretion, if:</p>
<ul><li>You breach these terms, our policies, or additional terms that apply to specific products.</li>
<li>We’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or court order.</li>
<li>We reasonably believe termination is necessary to prevent harm to you, us, other users, or third parties.</li>
<li>Your account has been inactive for more than two years.</li></ul>
<p>We will provide advance notice if reasonable to do so or required by applicable law. You can appeal any enforcement action by <a href="/contact">contacting</a> 3ee Games.</p>
<h2 id="indemnity"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#indemnity"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Indemnity</h2>
<p>If you use the services on behalf of a business or legal entity and not as an individual, you will indemnify and hold 3ee Games and its officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) related to (a) your access to or use of our services, (b) your content, or (c) your violation of these terms.</p>
<h2 id="services-as-is"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#services-as-is"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Services “AS IS”</h2>
<p>We strive to provide excellent services, but we can’t guarantee certain aspects. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 3ee Games, its affiliates, and their respective suppliers make no warranties, either express or implied, about the services. The services are provided “as is.” We also disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. If your jurisdiction doesn’t allow limitations on implied warranties, we limit the duration and remedies of such warranties to the full extent permissible under those laws.</p>
<p>This warranty doesn’t affect consumer rights under applicable law, including the legal guarantee in certain jurisdictions such as the European Union, which requires products and services to comply with this agreement and provides rights in case of non-conformity of a product or service.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#limitation-of-liability"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it’s illegal to do so. In countries where exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages resulting from our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement.</p>
<p>The information provided through the services is solely for informational purposes. We don’t confirm the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information. Your reliance on such information is at your own risk.</p>
<p>In countries where liability limitations are allowed, neither 3ee Games, its affiliates, nor our suppliers involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services will be liable, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, or damages for lost profits, lost revenues, lost savings, lost business opportunity, loss of data or goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure, or the cost of substitute services arising from these terms or the use or inability to use the services. This applies regardless of the legal theory, whether 3ee Games or its suppliers were informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a limited remedy provided in these terms fails to serve its essential purpose.</p>
<p>3ee Games isn’t liable for the conduct or content, whether online or offline, of any user of our services.</p>
<p>The exclusions and limitations of damages above are fundamental elements of the agreement between 3ee Games and you. The limitation of liability described above applies fully to residents of New Jersey.</p>
<h2 id="additional-important-information"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#additional-important-information"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Additional Important Information</h2>
<p>You have certain rights by law that can’t be limited by these terms, and we don’t intend to restrict those rights in any way.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement: These terms represent the complete agreement between you and 3ee Games regarding your use of our services.</p>
<p>Additional Terms: When additional terms apply to our products or services, they will govern your use of the specific product or service in the event of a conflict with these terms. </p>
<p>Bug Reporting: We support responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please visit <a href="https://3ee.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">https://3ee.com/contact/</a>.</p>
<p>Export Control: You agree to comply with all applicable import, export, and re-export control laws and restrictions, including those of the European Union and its member states, the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). You will not use the services in violation of such laws or regulations. Additionally, you represent and warrant that you are not located in North Korea or on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties, or subject to equivalent restrictions, as specified in the laws and regulations listed above or in your country’s laws. You may not download or use our services if you are located in a country or region subject to U.S. or E.U. government embargo (including Cuba, Iran, Syria, and the Crimea region) unless authorized by the United States and other relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Waiver, Severability, and Assignment: If you fail to follow these terms and we don’t immediately act, it doesn’t mean we’re giving up any of our legal rights (such as acting in the future). If any part of these terms is deemed invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by a court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not be affected. You may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written consent. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with our services.</p>
<p>Survival: Any part of these terms that, by their nature, should survive after termination of these terms will do so.</p>
<p>Updates to These Terms: We may update these terms (1) to reflect changes to our services or our business, (2) for legal or regulatory reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse on or of our services. If these changes materially affect your 3ee Games use or your legal rights, we’ll provide reasonable advance notice (unless the updates are urgent). Continuing to use our services after the changes take effect signifies your agreement to the changes. If you don’t agree, you must stop using our services.</p>
<h2 id="contact-information"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#contact-information"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Contact Information</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us at <a href="https://3ee.com/contact" rel="nofollow">https://3ee.com/contact</a>.
