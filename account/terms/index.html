<p>3ee Games provides video games that allow you to interact with other users and participate in public communities. Our services may also include access to certain software, features, and content that you can purchase from us or others.</p>
<p>All games developed by 3ee Games are provided by 3ee Games LLC.</p>
<h2 id="age-requirements-and-responsibility-of-parents-and-guardians"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#age-requirements-and-responsibility-of-parents-and-guardians"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Age requirements and responsibility of parents and guardians</h2>
<p>By accessing our services, you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country. We maintain a list of minimum ages around the world as a resource for you, but we aren’t able to guarantee that it is always accurate.</p>
<p>If you are old enough to access our services in your country, but not old enough to have authority to consent to our terms, your parent or guardian must agree to our terms on your behalf. Please ask your parent or guardian to read these terms with you. If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your teenager to use the services, then these terms also apply to you and you’re responsible for your teenager’s activity on the services.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-expect-from-us"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-you-can-expect-from-us"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What you can expect from us</h2>
<p>We’re actively developing new features and products to improve 3ee Games. As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering old services. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes. We are not liable for any such outages or service changes.</p>
<h2 id="your-account"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#your-account"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Your account</h2>
<p>To access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create a 3ee Games account. You can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). To access certain features or communities, you may need to verify your account or add other information to your account. Our Privacy Policy discusses what information we collect and how we use this information in more detail.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your 3ee Games account and that you enable two-factor authentication. If your account is compromised, we may not be able to restore it to you.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the contact information associated with your account. If you get locked out of your account, we’ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account, and we may not be able to restore your 3ee Games account to you if you no longer have access to that email account or phone number. We may also assume that any communications we’ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you.</p>
<p>You agree not to license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written approval.</p>
<h2 id="content-in-3ee-games-services"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#content-in-3ee-games-services"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Content in 3ee Games’ services</h2>
<h3 id="your-content"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#your-content"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Your Content</h3>
<p>When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, or stream) to our services. This may include text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.</p>
<p>You don’t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in the terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others’ use of your content.</p>
<p>Please understand the difference between posting in public and private spaces on 3ee Games, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content. To understand how we treat your personal information, see our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use 3ee Games. Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights. We don’t own those. But by using our services, you grant us a license—which is a form of permission—to do the following with your content, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, in connection with operating, developing, and improving our services:</p>
<ul><li>Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate your content in manners consistent with your use of the services. (For example, so we can store and display your content, such as a profile image.)</li>
<li>Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content if you’ve chosen to make it visible to others. (For example, so we can display your messages if you post them in public servers.)</li>
<li>Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat your content. (For example, so we can resize an image you post to fit on a mobile device.)</li>
<li>Sublicense your content, to allow our services to work as intended. (For example, so we can store your content with our cloud service providers.)</li></ul>
<p>This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this license), transferable, and perpetual.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content for any reason, including breach of these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or any applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p>We welcome feedback on our services. By sending us feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.</p>
<h3 id="3ee-games-content"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#3ee-games-content"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>3ee Games’ content</h3>
<p>Our services include some content that belongs to us. You may use this content as permitted by these terms, but we retain all intellectual property rights in our content.</p>
<h3 id="other-content"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#other-content"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Other content</h3>
<p>Other people’s content. Our services might also provide you with access to other people’s content. You may not use this content without that person’s consent, or as allowed by law. Other people’s content is theirs and doesn’t necessarily reflect 3ee Games’ own views. 3ee Games doesn’t endorse or verify the accuracy or reliability of content shared by 3ee Games users. We work hard to try to make 3ee Games a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot prevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or offensive. You agree we will not be liable for any harm caused by that content. You may report content that you think violates any of our policies. We have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or remove content at our discretion.</p>
<p>Third party features and content. Our services may also allow you to access third-party websites, features, apps, or other content. We provide you access only as a convenience to you, and are not responsible for the content or services available from these websites or resources.</p>
<h2 id="software-in-3ee-games-services"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#software-in-3ee-games-services"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Software in 3ee Games’ services</h2>
<p>License to our software. Some of our services allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, and non-assignable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our services.</p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or services. You also may not reverse engineer or decompile our software or services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so, unless you have our written consent or applicable law permits it.
Although we are granting you this license, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in our software and services.</p>
<p>Open source. Some of 3ee Games’ services include software subject to separate open source license terms, and your use of those services are subject to your compliance with those license terms, when applicable. We encourage you to review them, as some licenses may explicitly override these terms.</p>
<h2 id="copyright"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#copyright"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Copyright</h2>
<p>We respect the intellectual property of others and expect our users to do the same. See our Copyright &amp; IP Policy for information on how to file a copyright complaint.</p>
<h2 id="3ee-games-paid-services"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#3ee-games-paid-services"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>3ee Games’ paid services</h2>
<p>We won’t charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of our services, but you may be able to pay for additional features and products. 3ee Games’ Paid Services Terms also apply to any purchase you make through 3ee Games, and you may also be asked to agree to separate terms before purchasing or selling new offerings through 3ee Games.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions-on-your-use-of-3ee-games-services"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#restrictions-on-your-use-of-3ee-games-services"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Restrictions on your use of 3ee Games’ services</h2>

Fundamentally, do not do, try to do, or encourage or help others to do any of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Don’t use the services to do harm to yourself or others.

<p>Your right to terminate. You’re free to stop using 3ee Games’ services at any time and for any reason. You can delete your 3ee Games account through the <a href="/account/profile/">account profile</a> page. You can also disable your account, which restricts the processing of your personal information as described in our <a href="/account/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. Disabling your account does not terminate this agreement.</p>
<p>Our right to terminate. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and/or your access to some or all of our services with or without notice, at our discretion, including if:</p>
<ul><li>You breach these terms, our policies, or additional terms that apply to specific products.</li>

<li>We reasonably believe termination is necessary to prevent harm to you, us, other users, or third parties.</li>
<li>Your account has been inactive for more than two years.</li></ul>
<p>However, we will give you advance notice if reasonable to do so or required by applicable law. You can appeal any enforcement action by <a href="/contact">contacting</a> 3ee Games.</p>
<h2 id="indemnity"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#indemnity"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Indemnity</h2>
<p>If you are using the services on behalf of a business or legal entity and not in an individual capacity, then you will indemnify and hold 3ee Games and its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) related to (a) your access to or use of our services, (b) your content, or (c) your violation of these terms.</p>
<h2 id="services-as-is"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#services-as-is"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Services “AS IS”</h2>
<p>We work hard to offer great services, but there are certain aspects that we can’t guarantee. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 3ee Games, its affiliates, and their respective suppliers make no warranties, either express or implied, about the services. The services are provided “as is.” we also disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. The laws of certain jurisdictions or states do not allow limitations on implied warranties. To the extent such warranties cannot be disclaimed under the laws of your jurisdiction, we limit the duration and remedies of such warranties to the full extent permissible under those laws.</p>
<p>This warranty does not affect any consumer rights you might have under applicable law, including the legal guarantee in certain places such as the European Union that products and services must comply with this agreement and your rights in case of non-conformity of a product or service.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#limitation-of-liability"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so. In countries where the below types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we’re responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can’t be waived or limited by any contract or agreement.</p>
<p>The information presented on or through the services is made available solely for informational purposes. We do not confirm the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information. Any reliance you place on such information is solely at your own risk.</p>
<p>In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, neither 3ee Games, its affiliates, nor our suppliers involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services will be liable, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, or damages for lost profits, lost revenues, lost savings, lost business opportunity, loss of data or goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure, or the cost of substitute services of any kind arising out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or inability to use the services, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), product liability, or any other legal theory, and whether or not 3ee Games or its suppliers have been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy provided in these terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>Besides the types of liability we cannot limit by law (as described in this section), 3ee Games limits our liability to you to the greater of (a) the amounts you have paid us in the three months before you first assert a claim or (b) $100 (or the equivalent in your local currency).</p>
<p>3ee Games isn’t liable for the conduct or content, whether online or offline, of any user of our services.</p>
<p>The exclusions and limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between 3ee Games and you. The limitation of liability described above shall apply fully to residents of new jersey.</p>
<h2 id="more-important-items-for-your-inventory"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#more-important-items-for-your-inventory"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>More important items for your inventory</h2>
<p>You have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms.</p>
<p>Entire agreement. These terms cover the entire agreement between you and 3ee Games for your use of our services.</p>
<p>Additional terms. Where additional terms apply to our products or services, the additional terms will control with respect to your use of that product or service to the extent of any conflict with these terms.
Bug reporting. We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please visit <a href="https://3ee.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">https://3ee.com/contact/</a>.</p>
<p>Export Control. You agree to comply with all applicable import, export, and re-export control laws and restrictions, including but not limited to those of the European Union and its member states, the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), and will not use the services to cause a violation of such laws or regulations. Further, you represent and warrant that you are not located in North Korea, on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties, or otherwise subject to equivalent restrictions, as specified in the laws and regulations listed above or in your country’s laws. You may not download or use our services if you are located in a country or region subject to U.S. or E.U. government embargo (including Cuba, Iran, Syria, and the Crimea region) unless that use is authorized by the United States and other relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Waiver, severability, and assignment. If you fail to follow these terms and we don’t immediately act, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any of our legal rights (such as acting in the future). If any part of these terms ends up being invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not be affected. You may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written consent. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with our services.</p>
<p>Survival. Any part of these terms that by their nature should survive after termination of these terms will survive.</p>
<p>Updates to these terms. We may decide to update these terms (1) to reflect changes to our services or our business, (2) for legal or regulatory reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse on or of our services. If these changes materially affect your 3ee Games use or your legal rights, we’ll give you reasonable advance notice (unless the updates are urgent). If you continue to use our services after the changes have taken effect, it means that you agree to the changes. If you don’t agree, you must stop using our services.</p>
<p>Apple App Store. If you download the 3ee Games app from the Apple App Store or use our app on an iOS device, the below paragraph applies to you.</p>
<p>Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the 3ee Games app. If the app fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the app purchase price to you (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the 3ee Games app. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the 3ee Games app or your possession and use of it, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the 3ee Games app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party claim that your possession and use of the 3ee Games app infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights. Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these terms, and upon acceptance of the terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You must also comply with any applicable third-party terms of service when using the 3ee Games app.</p>
