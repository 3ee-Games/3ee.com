00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.310
this is a prototype of a game on

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.849
building all the tiles are designed by

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.990
cert over at open game art org the link

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.660
is in the description you can see this

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.270
game is a platformer there's a lot of

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619
vertical places that you can jump to and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.930
this entire level is built with tile

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.810
which is a level editor I'm building

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.120
this game super jump

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.620
see I've got a some sound effects when

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
the player is on a ladder or a rover -

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
different sound effects for that and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.239
this game is very out for so the jumpy

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.230
needs a lot of work and the AI is kind

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.820
of basic

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.760
[Music]

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.440
and then here's a boss like a mini boss

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.110
that comes out and so scripted event she

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.790
resurrects all the skills and said I

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.250
killed she summons the creepy horror and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.720
and this gives the player sense of

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:38.580
urgency jumping puzzles and this is all

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.510
built-in piled so I can focus on

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.210
designing the Goblin and not worry so

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.570
much about any integration with level

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.210
beta everything serialized and comes in

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.110
two days already

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.290
here's an example the super jump needs a

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.800
lot of work I can skip that whole area I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.200
design and the game has some looting

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.239
mechanics when I'm filling this down

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.430
instead of dropping into some arrows at

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.190
heart there's a kind of air

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.620
oh well I died so I'll show you the game

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.110
of tile and here's all the tiles I work

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.420
in layers so I have my background ground

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.120
and objects so I'll go over the ground

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.490
first these are all the platforms the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.000
player can collide with and in any place

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.980
where I don't want the player to go I

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.510
can block them off and there's where I

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.280
die so here you can see this is where I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.140
work on the placement and here's the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.100
background and you can see how I'm using

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.020
a black background in my game engine

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.880
instead of painting those tiles again

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.110
here's where I died and even the ladders

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.720
are background and I'll get into that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.880
with objects so objects are markers that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.800
I can put properties on and load them in

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.670
in the level data in the game engine so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.680
here is an enemy spawn and it's a type

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.120
of skeleton so here's where that

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.000
skeleton spawns here's the player spawn

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.100
you can see the creeping Horak spawn

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.180
down at the bottom and then here's enemy

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.470
spawns here's the ladder spawn and this

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.110
is a type of rope and then this is a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.010
type of vine so here is where I can use

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.160
the level data into the game engine to

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.020
play those sound effects so here's how I

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.440
I'm doing the sound effects I have an

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.630
object full of parameters that have an

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.880
array of sound effects so on ladder on

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.050
vine on rope

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.090
it picks one of those random sound

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.850
effects in there to play so when the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.000
player is on either one of those I'm

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.530
just looking at the level data and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.450
playing that sound effect

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.670
here's the where the boss spawns right

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.690
there and so objects can be used for

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.130
little markers

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.630
and they're pretty easy to get get it

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.810
into your game here's where I died and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.020
again here's here's the tiles there's

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.000
not very many but you can build some

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.030
great levels just with limiting yourself

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.400
so here I'm gonna show you how easy it

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.460
is just just to just copy and paste a

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.320
bunch of objects and have a bunch of

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.080
skeletons spawn and so I would encourage

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.930
developers to find points in your game

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.480
where you can integrate a proven tool

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.440
that works like tiled and integrated

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.050
into your game and you can build levels

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.720
fairly fast and prototype quickly and

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.080
you can focus on a tool like tiled that

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.930
allows you to really think about how

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.200
you're designing your level and then you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.360
can load it in and just like you saw

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.400
with the Medusa I can script in events

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.400
based on different objects that I place

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:25.430
in the level hope I don't die thanks for

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.880
watching
